Inject Challenge (Rubyist Badge)
================

A rewrite of the inject method.
This was the second weekend challenge at Makers Academy.

Technologies Used:
-------
* Ruby
* Rspec

How to Use:
-------

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ajitsy/inject-challenge.git
$ cd inject-challenge
$ bundle install
$ irb
```

Use the method the same way as the "inject method" (see [ruby-doc](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject) for instruction) except I call the method my_inject instead of inject.

Ue Rspec to run the tests
